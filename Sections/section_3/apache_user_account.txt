# Provide the configuration lines you will update to ensure that Apache launches with group name as "apache-group" and user account as "apache-user".

First, we create a new user with "sudo useradd apache-user"
Then we restrict its access with "sudo usermod -s /usr/sbin/nologin apache-user"

then for more restriction we prevent the user from running sudo
"sudo visudo" and add "apache-user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: !ALL"
then we add the group by "sudo groupadd apache-group"

In "/etc/apache2/envvars" we replace:

export APACHE_RUN_USER=www-data
export APACHE_RUN_GROUP=www-data

with the following:

export APACHE_RUN_USER=apache-user
export APACHE_RUN_GROUP=apacher-group
