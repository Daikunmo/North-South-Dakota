# provide the additional filename that you have identified as a potentially suspicious file. Also provide details about the Command and control Domain which is hardcoded inside this file.

Horrible formatting and readability, just horrible.

The first thing the code does when run is flushing all the iptables rules, which is a huge security risk.
Then stopping iptables entirely.
Then it adds some execution permission commands to /etc/rc.local.

Then the code assigns some variables.
m = SSH-T, seems to be the name of a process.
script = SSH-One, which is the name of the script.
hfs_m and hfs_s seem to be links to a sketchy website, same domain and ports but different subdirectories.

Then it removes anything related to to SSH-T in the /etc folder.

Then it enters a while true loop.
to summarise what's happening inside, it checks if a process called SSH-T.
If the result exists, it sleeps for 10 seconds.
If it doesn't, it looks for a file in the /tmp directory with the name of SSH-T.
If it does find said file, it tries to execute it, or run it.
If said file doesn't exist, it downloads the suspicous link which is called hfs_m, might be a script, no, definetly.
After that, it gives execution permission to the downloaded script and executes it.

Then it does the same thing with itself, with minor changes.
Like hfs_m being changed to hfs_s.
